## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **Raw Data**: Sales, Purchase, and Vendor Invoice data (6 Excel sheets)
- **Database**: Integrated into SQLite using Python
- **Notebook**: Python (Jupyter) used for SQL queries, EDA, and analysis
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib (donut, bar, histogram, heatmap, scatter plots)
- **Statistical Testing**: t-tests performed for hypothesis testing


## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- SQLite (via `sqlite3` or `SQLAlchemy`)
- Jupyter Notebook


## ðŸ“Š Key Highlights

- Integrated multi-sheet Excel data into a structured SQLite database
